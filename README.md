### 🦄 😹

👋 Hi! I'm a polyglot developer + designer; 👩‍🎨 Artisan of logics and pixels.

### ✨ Currently seeking innovations
In pursuit of the next innovative idea. Have an idea worth sharing? [💬 🤔 Let's brainstorm.](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=2212463825&text=Hello%2C%20world!)

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
One commit at a time building [Switch for macOS](https://github.com/ahkohd/switch-desktop). Yay! 🤕 I have tons of articles still in drafts.
At leisure, I make indie games, at other times I contribute to open-source.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
Myself, Swift and Rust. Weird right? 🌚 I agree.
